       "  'giantbomb-description': 'Overview Final Fantasy X transitioned the Final Fantasy franchise from the  PlayStation  to  PlayStation 2 . Developed and published by Square, it was released on December 26, 2001 and was the first of the series to feature fully three-dimensional backgrounds, which the \"Emotion Engine\" made possible. The PlayStation 2\\'s graphical capabilities allowed a higher polygon count and lighting and shadows to appear more natural and realistic than in prior Final Fantasies. Final Fantasy X is similar to other installments in the franchise; the story follows one plotline but contains a number of subplots which relate back. Most of these are listed below, for a recap of the important events of Final Fantasy X check out the \"recap\" section. In 2011, an HD version of the game was announced for  Playstation Vita  and  Playstation 3 . The remaster would go on to be released on the  PlayStation 4  and the  PC  via the  Steam  platform as well. The game is bundled together with its sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, as part of the  Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster . Gameplay Final Fantasy X, compared to previous games in the series, features a number of gameplay discrepancies. Foremost is the elimination of a world map.  Spira  is explored from a behind-the-back perspective, rather than an overhead, which is mostly kept on a straight-forward track with little deviation in the path from start to finish. The majority of battles in the game take place as  random encounters . Combat Final Fantasy X\\'s combat system is strictly  turn-based  and turn order is determined by the speed of the character. The battle screen charts a menu, displaying characters\\' upcoming turns, allowing players to plan ahead. The active battle team is limited to three characters, but the player can switch-out a character on their turn with a reserve. Each party member has a particular specialization that gives him his defining role in combat: Tidus  is a speedy fighter that can use time magic such as Haste and Slow. His main weapon is a sword and his Overdrive ability is Swordplay. Yuna  is both the party\\'s White Mage and Summoner. She is able to equip staffs and summons her aeons in Overdrive using Grand Summon. Lulu  is the party Black Mage that can cast the majority of the game\\'s attack spells. She wields various puppets resembling characters from previous FF games as her weapon. Her Overdrive, Fury, allows her to cast a single spell many times. Auron  is a pure physical fighter that deals high damage. He uses larger and heavier swords than Tidus and has the Bushido Overdrive. Wakka  has an advantage against aerial enemies. His weapon of choice is a blitzball which is powered-up with his Slots Overdrive. Rikku  is an agile thief-like character who can steal from enemies. She wear various gloves to aid her in fighting and blends items together with her Mix Overdrive. Rikku also has an advantage against small machina enemies and can easily dismantle them. Kimahri  has the Blue Mage ability to learn certain enemy attacks that are used against him with his Lancet ability. He wields large spears and uses his Ronso Rage when in Overdrive. The key to using the game\\'s combat system effectively lies in the ability to switch characters in and out to take advantage of their strengths and enemy weaknesses. Sphere Grid Final Fantasy X eschews the tradition of having the player accrue  experience points  to level-up and earn stat boosts and abilities which are tethered to the level; instead, it introduces the Sphere Grid, a field of nodes connected by tracks. Each character begins at a different point and can advance, in any direction, by earning the game\\'s equivalent of experience points. This allows characters to untether from a particular class (e.g., black mage) and become mixed, or simply one different class than intended (e.g., Lulu as a warrior-type). Items called Key Spheres are necessary, however, to traverse the Sphere Grid in this way, and these become available rather early in the game. To unlock stat boosts and new abilities, the player spends special sphere items such as Power Spheres and Speed Spheres which accord to the kind of stat and ability. Overdrive Much like a \"limit break\" from the two previous installments, Final Fantasy X features its own unique and powerful attacks for characters: the Overdrive. The Overdrive gauge, initially, builds as the character is damaged (this Overdrive mode is called \"stoic\"), but other Overdrive modes can be unlocked and alternative battle actions can build the gauge, e.g., inflicting damage (\"warrior\"), defeating enemies (\"hero\") or even healing (\"healer\"). Each character\\'s Overdrive is tied to him and cannot be learned by the other party members. Each Overdrive also has its own gameplay mechanics that determine the damage inflicted. For example, Auron\\'s Bushido Overdrive requires the player to input a specific button sequence for full effect. Each of Yuna\\'s summons, additionally, have their own Overdrive gauges and abilities. If Yuna uses her Grand Summon Overdrive, she can immediately call forth a summon to use its own Overdrive regardless of whether or not its Overdrive gauge was filled before the Grand Summon was invoked. Plot Final Fantasy X begins in  medias res  with the protagonist, Tidus, looking over a ruined Zanarkand, as he starts to narrate the events that led him and his companions there. His story begins just before a big Blitzball game, in an unharmed Zanarkand, where he is a sports star. Sin attacks the city amid the game, sucking up both Tidus and his father\\'s friend, Auron. Tidus awakes alone in a temple\\'s ruins, where he meets a group of Al Bhed salvages. One of them is Rikku, through which Tidus learns that Zanarkand was destroyed by Sin a thousand years ago. Tidus helps the Al Bhed recover a large sunken Airship just before they are again attacked by Sin. Tidus wakes up alone once more, washed up on a beach on the island of Besaid. Tidus meets the captain of a blitzball team, Wakka, and quickly impresses him with his blitzball skills. Wakka invites him into the village for food, and along the way, they meet Luzzu and Gatta, Crusaders. Tidus feigns that he does not remember who they are because of Sin\\'s toxins (which cause memory loss). He discovers that they are a group formed eight-hundred years ago, by Lord Mi\\'ihen, to battle Sin. Tidus remarks, to Gatta\\'s surprise: \"What, you have been fighting eight hundred years, and you still have not beat it?\" Tidus rests in Wakka\\'s hut, and Wakka leaves with a priest of Yevon to the temple, where Yuna has entered the Cloister of Trials and not returned for a full day. Tidus violates the teachings and enters the Cloister while the summoner prays inside. Wakka later introduces him to her, who plans to make a pilgrimage to the ruins of Zanarkand, as her father, Braska, did ten years before her. At Zanarkand, she will summon the \"Final Aeon\" and temporarily destroy Sin, bringing about a ten-year-long \"Calm.\" Tidus meets Yuna\\'s guardians, Lulu and Kimahri, who will accompany Yuna on her journey along with Wakka. Yuna acquires the first aeon, Valefor, in Besaid\\'s temple to begin her pilgrimage, and Wakka gives Tidus a sword belonging to his dead brother, Chappu. He asks Tidus to join them until they reach Luca, search for anyone he knows, and play for the Besaid Aurochs in an upcoming tournament. Sin attacks en route to Kilika The party sails to Kilika and is attacked by Sin at sea; after the group repels Sin, it turns to Kilika, killing most of its population. The party arrives safely, however, to make the second stop on Yuna\\'s pilgrimage. Ascending the temple\\'s steps, Wakka asks Tidus about fiends in Zanakard, which surprises him; he segues with this line of thought that Sin does not necessarily kill people but transports them through time and back again. Lulu chastises Wakka for clinging to this absurd belief in the hope that his brother, Chappu, may not have died fighting Sin with the Crusaders the previous year. The party battles a Sin Spawn, and the Aurochs, who are traveling along with them to Luca, are confronted and taunted by the Luca Goers, a rival blitzball team. Tidus responds that this year, their goal is not to \\'do their best,\\' as Wakka would say, but to win. Another rival, this time a summoner, by the name of Dona, is introduced. She denigrates Yuna for having so many guardians, emphasizing \"quality over quantity\" and pointing out that Lord Braska had only two guardians, and herself one, Barthello. The guardians descend to the Cloister of Trials, sans Tidus, who is not yet a guardian; regardless, Donna reappears, and Barthello forces him into the Cloister. Yuna acquires the second aeon, Ifrit. The group continues to Luca, where the Aurochs will face the Al Bhed Psyches in their first match of the blitzball tournament. Yuna catches wind that Sir Auron has been spotted in a nearby café, and she, Kimahri, and Tidus leave in search. A scuffle breaks out in the café between Kimhari and Biran and Yenke, two of his clansmen from Mount Gagazet, who taunt Kimahri for being the smaller Ronso. Al Bhed kidnaps Yuna in this midst, and they demand the Aurochs forfeit the match in exchange for her release. Kimahri and Tidus, along with Lulu, track down the Al Bhed to a ship and defeat their machina to win back Yuna. A sphere broadcast shows that the Aurochs have beat the Psyches, although Wakka is injured. Tidus returns to the locker room and replaces Wakka in the upcoming match against the Goers. This is the first playable blitzball match for the player and can be either won or lost, altering a cut scene later. If Tidus learned the Jecht Shot on the S.S. Winnow, he could use the shot here after gaining a level. Whatever the case, the stadium is attacked by fiends after the blitzball tournament. Seymour Guado and his aeon, Anima, save everyone, although Tidus and Wakka defeat several foes in the blitzball pool, and Auron reappears to vanquish a few in the stands. Tidus finds Auron, who informs the group that he plans to join them as a guardian. Tidus revealed to the fact that Sin is his father by Auron, acquiesces to follow. The group continues, encountering Sin at Operation Mi\\'ihen: the joint effort between the Crusaders and Al Bhed to defeat Sin with forbidden machina. Many of each group are vanquished in vain, and Maester Seymour intervenes to help the party defeat Sin Spawn, the creature used to bait Sin. Sin turns away from the carnage, and Tidus swims in a short catharsis before returning to the shore. The pilgrimage continues to Djose, where injured people and felled litter the temple\\'s path, where Yuna attains Ixion, the third aeon. They make for the Moonflow, where Yuna is abducted amid a ride on the Shoopuff by the Al Bhed. Wakka and Tidus, the only members of the party able to battle underwater, dive and save Yuna from a machina in a boss battle. Shortly after, the group discovers a disguised Al Bhed washed ashore. She reveals herself to be Rikku, who is both one of the abductors and Yuna\\'s cousin. She confers with Yuna and Lulu and presents herself to Sir Auron, who allows her to become a guardian. All arrive at Guadosalam, where Seymour proposes to Yuna before leaving for Macalania Temple. While traveling there through the Thunder Plains, Yuna tells her guardians that she will marry Seymour for the sake of Spira\\'s happiness. At the temple, the group finds a sphere in possession of Yuna, recorded by Seymour\\'s father, Jyscal. It details the malcontent and hate his son possesses, as Jyscal foretells of his murder at the hands of his son. At this knowledge, the group enters the Cloister of Trials and makes for Yuna, who is already praying in the chamber of the fayth for the fourth aeon, Shiva. Altogether, they fight the Maester Seymour and fell him. Tromell, a servant of Seymour, fetches Seymour\\'s body, refuses his sending with the assistance of two Guado. All flee the temple, chased by Guado, and then fall through the ice of Macalania after a boss battle with a Wendigo. Far below the temple, the group feels Sin\\'s presence through its toxins and finds itself transported and dispersed to different locations on the desert-like Bikanel Island, home of the Al Bhed. The party regroups, minus one member, unable to find Yuna. Rikku leads everyone to the Al Bhed\\'s \"Home,\" which is arrived at under attack by the Guado and Yevon. Violators of the teachings inculcate the belief that machina must be eschewed to achieve atonement, after which Sin will vanish; the Al Bhed have also earned this wrath for abducting summoners, who are the only real, practical way of vanishing Sin. Tidus learns, in the Summoner\\'s Sanctum, where Issaru and Donna and their guardians are held, that the Final Summoning will kill any summoner who performs it, including Yuna. Cid, Rikku\\'s father, resolved and failed to save Yuna, who has been absconded to Bevelle to be forcefully married to the dead and unsent Seymour. The Wedding The party travels to Bevelle on an airship, which is the one salvaged at the beginning of the game after Home is rocketed by the airship\\'s machina. Gatecrashing the wedding, Seymour orders the guardians\\' execution; however, Yuna threatens to fall to her death in protest, and Rikku takes advantage of this distraction by throwing an Al Bhed flash grenade. Yuna flees, summoning Valefore, and the others in the group make for the Bevelle temple. There, Yuna acquires the fifth aeon, Bahamut. As she emerges from the chamber of fayth, all are ambushed by Yevonites, who bring them to trial. The farcical trial presided over by the maesters of Yevon: Kelk Ronso, Kinoc, Mica, and Seymour himself, ends in the party being sentenced to their death in the Via Purifico. Yuna escapes with Auron, Kimahri, and Lulu in tow, defeating Issaru, a rival summoner, before exiting the labyrinth portion of the Purifico. Tidus, thrown into a maze of underwater passages with Wakka and Rikku, also escape after defeating Evrae. The entire party, emergent, defeats Seymour in battle a second time. After a respite in part of the Macalania Woods and a romantic embrace between Tidus and Yuna (in the famous scene which plays \"Suteki da ne\"), the party travels through the Calm Lands and onto Mt. Gagazet, the Ronso homeland. Halfway up the mountain, Kimahri encounters his old tribe members, who tell him to turn back, as he was banished from the mountain long ago. Kimahri fights his tribesmen, Biran and Yenke, defeating them and earning their respect. When the party reaches the summit, they encounter Seymour, whose powers have continued to grow in death and encompass now levitation, and learn that he slaughtered the Ronso tribe behind him. The group defeats Seymour for the third time and continues down the mountainside toward the ruins of Zanarkand. Before reaching the bottom of the mountain, Tidus learns that he, his father, Jecht, and the Zanarkand known to them are dream-like entities created by Yevon, the real Zanarkand\\'s ancient ruler. After this, the party reaches the bottom of the mountain and ends Tidus\\' flashback sequence, which had begun at the beginning of the game. Inside the Temple of Zanarkand, the group learns from Lady Yunalesca that the Final Aeon is created from the spirit and life of one of the summoner\\'s guardians, the last of which had been Braska\\'s guardian, Jecht. A flashback visible to the entire group occurs; it shows Auron, ten years ago, attempting to attack Yunalesca for the deaths of Braska and Jecht. Yunalesca fells Auron in this display, revealing to the party that Auron is an Unsent himself. Cid\\'s airship attacking Sin Yuna does not wish for any of her companions to be sacrificed, which angers Yunalesca and sparks a confrontation. After defeating Yunalesca, the group determines to find a new way to defeat Sin, permanently and without sacrifice, so they attack the monster with Cid\\'s airship and enter its body. Soon after this, the party encounters and defeats Seymour for a final time, and Yuna sends him to the Farplane, ending his life forever. They encounter the spirit of Jecht, defeating him and then sacrificing all of Yuna\\'s aeons to destroy Yu Yevon, ending Sin and its ability to be reborn. Auron is laid to rest on the Farplane, and the spirits of the fayth are all released, causing the aeons, the dream-like Zanarkand, and Tidus to dissipate. Yuna pledges to help rebuild Spira now that it is free of Sin and asks that no one forget those who died to make it possible. Plot Analysis Final Fantasy X is thick with lore and hidden stories throughout the fifty-hour adventure. Many of these hidden gems can be overlooked by players who are simply focused on finishing the game. These next few sections are dedicated to analyzing and pointing out the significant moments that you may have missed. IMPORTANT:  Sections that contain spoilers will be marked with a *. Anything you could find out from reading the manual, or playing the game for three hours is not a spoiler. Anything from the introduction sequence of the game will be marked with one * (10 hours in). Anything from the middle of the storyline will be marked with two ** (10-32 hours in). Anything from the end section of the game will be marked with three *** (32-45 hours in). Character Subplots Final Fantasy X has seven main characters that the player can control throughout the game. Each character has fully developed personalities. Every character has unique conflicts that they fight through for the duration of the game\\'s story. This next section covers each of the seven characters and the unique subplots that they have. For the sake of organization each entry will have the first initial of the character\\'s name so no one gets confused. So: T idus  = (T) Auron  = (A) Rikku  = (R) W akka  = (W) Lulu  = (L) Yuna  = (Y) Kimahri  (K) (T) Zanarkand Tidus\\' hometown, Zanarkand, is believed to have been destroyed a thousand years ago according to the religion of Spira: Yevon. Tidus has some obvious trouble believing this since the prologue of the game takes place in Zanarkand on the day of the assumed destruction of the city. Zanarkand serves as the driving force for Tidus for the majority of the game. He tags along with Yuna and her guardians so he can find Auron, and he only wants to find Auron so he can figure out how to get back to Zanarkand. When Tidus learns that Yuna\\'s destination is Zanarkand, he sticks with the crew so he can see his home once again. This conflict establishes the goal of the story from the very beginning. Players are supposed to wonder whether or not Zanarkand is really destroyed, in the same way that Tidus questions the validity of everyone\\'s story. In addition to being crucial to the creation of the story, Zankarkand also provides a geographical end point to the game. Players are given an idea of where the game will end, and won\\'t have to stress during the final hours of the game bemused by the thought \"is this going to end?\" Tidus\\' interests, however, are not exclusive to his hometown ... (T) Love Interest - Yuna *** Yuna\\'s timid and kind personality gives players a person they can easily care about Yuna is introduced halfway through Tidus\\' progression on Besaid Island. Tidus is instantly attracted to her due to her beauty and approachable demeanor. The relationship that forms between Tidus and Yuna over-arcs the entire storyline; and despite nothing serious occurring between the two until the tail-end of the game, characters and party members poke fun at their high-school relationship. Tidus initially starts talking to Yuna because she seems very friendly, and is the only other character of the cast who is close to Tidus\\' age. Although the relationship is physically very tame, Tidus and Yuna show signs of interest in one another in a few key points of the story. The first being Yuna\\'s suggestion that Tidus join her group of guardians. This act could be seen as Yuna trying to express her feelings for Tidus; although it may be more likely that her kind and philanthropic outlook has manifest to help Tidus find his home again. The second sign comes much later, during a scene amid the destruction of the Al Bhed\\'s Home. Tidus learns that Yuna will die when she summons the final aeon that defeats Sin and is enraged by this, swearing to find another way which will spare her life. Near the final hours of the game, Tidus is informed of what The Fayth are capable of when he discovers that he is a figment whom they have created and does not actually exist. After this, Tidus begins to develop a more mature and understanding outlook on life. (T) Maturation *** As the opening cinematic clearly states: this is Tidus\\' story. The game follows Tidus\\' trajectory from being a teenager to a young adult through his experience in Spira. Tidus struggles, throughout, with several reoccurring conflicts that plague his life: Tidus\\' immature personality traits were designed to resonate with the teenagers playing the game Living in his father\\'s shadow His feelings for Yuna General understanding of Spira Tidus struggles to get away from his father\\'s history. In Zanarkand, he is known as \"the son of Jecht\", and a narrator in the beginning of the game references the potential spectacle of Tidus preforming his father\\'s famous Jecht Shot. Things are similar in the world of Spira too, since Jecht guarded  Lord Braska  (Yuna\\'s father) along with Auron and helped bring The Calm to the people. Tidus is called by other possessive nicknames besides \"son of Jecht\" for plot and narrative reasons, but this also works around the fact that players can name Tidus whatever they want. The name \"Tidus\" is never spoken in the game\\'s dialogue. In addition to Jecht and learning to express his feelings for Yuna, Tidus\\' general understanding of Spira is a topic that sprawls, for example, death to racism (more on this later). Death is widely accepted since Sin terrorizes the cities and villages so frequently; however, Tidus comes from a utopian society, and this jars him. After Sin attacks Kilika and Yuna preforms a sending, Tidus says: \"I wished there would never be a next time. No more people being killed by Sin. No more sendings for Yuna. Everyone stood there watching her. It was strange, and somehow … horrifying. I never wanted to see it again\". Lulu explains that the unsent become bitter, envying the living, becoming fiends. By the time the party reaches Guadosalam and visits the Farplane, Yuna views her parents as Wakka his brother,  Chappu , and Tidus develops an understanding of death and peaceable death in Spira. Jyscal, Seymour\\'s father, appears to emerge from the Farplane and into the world and Auron remarks that he has died an \"unclean death\", before Yuna \"sends\" him. Seymour, who himself remains unsent after his death in Macalania Temple, explains later: \"Death is a sweet slumber. All the pain of life is gently swept away … Ah, yes. So you see … if all life were to end on Spira, all suffering would end\". Seymour voices his wish to become Sin and destroy Spira. It appears his objective would perhaps be to manifest a population of unsent, with only those of a strong will and attachment to the world remaining. Maester Mika, a revered leader even among the group (at least until he condemns them to the Via Purifico as traitors of Yevon), is revealed to be an unsent and an example of who might remain. The morbid logic of Seymour is denied by Tidus, who comes to accept even his own transience once he is revealed by the fayth to be a dream-like entity. Tidus grows to accepts death, not as a power which can be harnessed, but as the last in a natural stage of events, even at his young age. Final Fantasy X is mostly a story about maturing from a teenager to young adult. This is tailored in specific ways to resonate with fans of the Final Fantasy series, although broad enough to be relatable to a general audience. Tidus\\' struggles may not mirror every player\\'s personal problems, but his issues allow a good deal of imagination, so players can relate to the game how they want. There are, however, several other characters who go through a similar \"coming of age\" tale. (R) Self-Identity *** Rikku is introduced as the happy and upbeat, \"don\\'t-worry-be-happy\" type; however, as the game progresses, Rikku reveals to the other party members that she thinks her optimistic attitude gives some the impression that she isn\\'t very intelligent. She fantasizes about becoming like Lulu, the black mage of the party. Lulu\\'s demeanor is very serious, and she only speaks when she has to. Because of her envy of Lulu, Rikku attempts to copy the way Lulu might act sometimes. She even tries to learn Black Magic spells in order to be viewed similarly. (This is quite significant given Rikku\\'s phobia of the thunder spell, which once zapped her at a young age when her brother (actually named  Brother ) was practicing). When the party is stranded at the bottom of Macalania Temple, beneath the ice, Tidus relates to her that Wakka is in shock but Lulu is not unlike herself; Rikku responds: \"She’s so together. All grown up, I guess\". Kimarhi speaks to Rikku and says \"Rikku should be Rikku.\" His few words are expounded on by Tidus, who says that each person is made a certain way, and that instead of trying to change who she is, she should embrace it. Tidus ties this back to the pilgrimage, explaining that someone has to be optimistic when times are grim. Rikku takes the advice and continues being herself. She is able, eventually, to reveal her more mature thoughts later in the game, as she builds trust with her party members. International Edition Primary Changes The main changes from the original Japanese release contains all the updates found in the North American. It maintains an English voice cast while maintaining the same Japanese text. Like all other \"re-releases\" of Square games in japan, this is also considered as the \"final-cut\" of the game. The PAL version of Final Fantasy X could be seen as the only \"English\" release of Final Fantasy X International, as it contains all the following changes, except the Prelude to Final Fantasy X-2. Sphere Grid There\\'s an extra sphere grid which starts the players off in the center of the grid. This will allow all characters to progress however they want. Instead of locking Lulu as a primary \"black mage\", she is free to pick whatever style of play she wants. However, selecting the new Grid will result in less status boosts and overall smaller grid. Dark Aeons During the course of the game, the player is allowed to fight the dark version of Aeons. These are considered some of the most powerful boss fights in the game. It\\'s impossible to defeat the harder Dark Aeons without unlocking every characters Damage Limit and Status Limits. After defeating all the Dark Aeons, the player is allowed to fight the hardest monster of Final Fantasy X, Penance. Prelude to Final Fantasy X-2 The Japanese version contains a bonus feature which leads up to the story of Final Fantasy X-2. Called the \"Eternal Calm\", this feature highlights life without Tidus and Yuna understanding the changes of the world. It finally closes with a man who looks like Tidus locked up, and this drives Yuna to find her true love. Bonus DVD Both the Japanese and European versions of Final Fantasy X International. The bonus DVD contains the making of documentary of Final Fantasy X. It also contains interviews with the English voice actors of Tidus and Yuna. The extras of the DVD are some trailers of Final Fantasy X and the music video of the Final Fantasy X love song, \"Suteki Da Ne\" performed by RIKKI.

       "  'wikipedia-summary': 'Final Fantasy X is a 2001 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for PlayStation 2. The tenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, it is the first game in the series to feature fully three-dimensional areas (though some areas were still pre-rendered), and voice acting. Final Fantasy X replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the \"Sphere Grid\".\\nSet in the fantasy world of Spira, a setting influenced by the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan, the game\\'s story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in Spira after Sin attacked his home city of Zanarkand. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus becomes a guardian to summoner Yuna to destroy Sin upon learning its true identity is that of his missing father, Jecht.\\nDevelopment of Final Fantasy X began in 1999, with a budget of more than $32.3 million ($59.1 million in 2023 dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu\\'s fellow composers. Final Fantasy X was both a critical and commercial success, shipping over 8.5 million units worldwide on PlayStation 2. It is considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made. It was followed by Final Fantasy X-2 in March 2003, making it the first Final Fantasy game to have a direct game sequel. As of September 2021, the Final Fantasy X series had sold over 20.8 million units worldwide, and at the end of March 2022 had surpassed 21.1 million. A remaster, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster was released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, for PlayStation 4 in 2015, Windows in 2016, and for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019.',\n",
       "  'wikipedia-gameplay': 'Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.\\nThe gameplay of Final Fantasy X differs from that of previous Final Fantasy games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In the game, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game\\'s locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X features numerous minigames, including the underwater sport blitzball.Combat: Final Fantasy X introduces the Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) system in place of the series\\' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first used in Final Fantasy IV. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player\\'s turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. \"Limit Breaks\", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in Final Fantasy X as \"Overdrives\". In this incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.\\nFinal Fantasy X overhauled the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the \"Aeons\" in X arrive and replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles; three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests.\\nSphere Grid: As with previous titles in the series, players can develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional experience point system is replaced by a new system called the \"Sphere Grid\". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after leveling up, each character gains \"Sphere Levels\" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. \"Spheres\" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.\\nThe Sphere Grid system allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the White Mage-roled Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman Auron into a healer. The International and PAL versions of the game include an optional \"Expert\" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.\\nBlitzball: Blitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.\\nBlitzball is introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is a main part of Tidus\\'s character, and is in the first scene where the game\\'s main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.\\n',\n",

       "  'wikipedia-plot': 'Setting and characters: Final Fantasy X is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi\\'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous Final Fantasy games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.\\nSpira features a variety of races, though predominantly populated by humans. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira\\'s sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"fiends\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most Final Fantasy games.\\nThere are seven main playable characters in Final Fantasy X, starting with Tidus (James Arnold Taylor/Masakazu Morita), a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira. To do so, he joins Yuna (Hedy Burress/Mayuko Aoki), a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\". Journeying with them are: Kimahri Ronso (John DiMaggio/Katsumi Chō), a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood; Wakka (also DiMaggio/Kazuya Nakai), a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin; and Lulu (Paula Tiso/Rio Natsuki), a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka. During the journey, they are joined by Auron (Matt McKenzie/Hideo Ishikawa), a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus\\' and Yuna\\'s fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior; and Rikku (Tara Strong/Marika Matsumoto), Yuna\\'s cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.\\nStory: Tidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. He narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game\\'s storyline. It begins in his home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned blitzball player and son of the famous blitzball star Jecht, an abusive father who disappeared 10 years prior. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\". Sin destroys Zanarkand and takes Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira. Upon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers, with the young Rikku explaining that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team. Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin with her guardians Lulu, a mage of black magic, and Kimahri, a member of the Ronso tribe. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\" called Sinspawn. Tidus meets Auron again, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna\\'s guardian upon revealing that Jecht is Sin\\'s true identity. Ten years ago, Auron and Jecht bodyguarded Yuna\\'s late father Braska to defeat Sin but Jecht became a new Sin. As Yuna\\'s party continues their pilgrimage, Tidus reunites with Rikku, who the party learns is Yuna\\'s cousin.\\nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado and major clergy member Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira\\'s sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group discovers a message from the spirit of Seymour\\'s father, Lord Jyscal; he declares that he was killed by his own son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna and kills Seymour in battle; soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna and sending the others to the arid Bikanel Island. While searching for Yuna at the island\\'s Al Bhed settlement, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, the center of the clergy’s power, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding, after which Seymour reveals his plan to become Sin with Yuna\\'s help. The party defeats him a second time and escapes with Yuna. The group heads toward the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.\\nShortly before arriving, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand\\'s survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. Once they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. The group decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus\\' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon.\\nAfter the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon — the deity of the Yevon religion who was a summoner from Zanarkand before losing his humanity and mind — is behind Sin\\'s cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin\\'s body in order to find Yu Yevon. Inside Sin, the party finds the unsent Seymour, who had been absorbed by Sin and intends to control it from within. Yuna defeats him for the final time before sending him to the Farplane. Shortly after, the group reaches the core of Sin and finds Jecht\\'s imprisoned spirit. Tidus and Jecht come to terms with the latter\\'s abuse. Jecht transforms into his Final Aeon form, asking the party to defeat him and end the cycle; they do so. With Sin\\'s host defeated, Yuna summons and the group defeats each aeon after Yu Yevon possesses each one until finally they vanquish Yu Yevon himself.\\nSin\\'s cycle of rebirth ends when Yuna sends Sin and the Aeons to the farplane, and the spirits of Spira\\'s fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had been revealed to be unsent, is sent to the Farplane. Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water and swims towards the ocean surface.\\n',\n",

       "  'giantbomb-intro': 'Journey back to Spira two years later to rescue the missing Tidus in this first direct sequel to a Final Fantasy title.',\n",
       "  'giantbomb-description': 'Overview Final Fantasy X-2 starts off two years after the events of  Final Fantasy X , the Eternal Calm had just been established permanently, and  Tidus  had vanished from  Yuna \\'s life, apparently forever. Yet just as Yuna begins to believe that Tidus is gone from her life forever,  Rikku  brings Yuna a sphere (a device that is basically a camera) that shows an image of someone who bears a striking resemblance to Tidus. Once Yuna sees the sphere she is determined to find all the others in the area in the hopes that they will reveal more clues to the whereabouts of this person who looks exactly like Tidus. Once they arrive at the area where Rikku initially found the sphere a group of sphere-hunters (they find spheres with historic information on them and sell them to the highest bidder) challenge them to a fight to see who will earn the right to look for spheres. Ironically, these same sphere-hunters had had a run in with Yuna and her gang before, one of the sphere-hunters had found a sphere that let her look like Yuna and she impersonated the young summoner. After Yuna finds more spheres she learns that the Aeons are starting to become corrupted and she must travel to old temples to exorcise the spirits that once let her summon their might. Characters Yuna, Age: 19. Dressphere: Gunner. Yuna - \"After defeating  Sin , Yuna returned to her home on  Besaid . The days passed without incident, but still she sensed something missing in her quiet existence. A movie sphere that Rikku shows her gives her a reason to journey once more.\" \"For now, life as a sphere hunter affords Yuna the chance to live on the wild side. Old habits die hard, though. Yuna still can\\'t walk away from people in need.\" Rikku, Age: 17. Dressphere: Thief. Rikku - \"In the two years since she helped Yuna defeat Sin,Rikku has travelled with other Al Bhed around Spira, teaching people all there is to know about machina. During the so-called \"search for truth\" that overtook Spira after Sin\\'s defeat, a group of Al Bhed joined the ranks of sphere hunters. With their airship, the Celsius, as a base, Rikku and  Brother  founded the Gullwings. Rikku invited Yuna to join the Gullwings, and they have been travelling together ever since. As always, Rikku\\'s endless supply of energy keeps the team on their toes.\" Paine, Age: 18. Dressphere: Warrior. Paine - \"Paine is armed with a one-handed sword and a lukewram attitude. It seems she joined the Gullwings because of something that happend in her past. However, none of the Gullwings know excactly what that might be. The often ridiculous antics of the Gullwings tend to prompt sarcastic remarks from Paine, but the others don\\'t seem to worry about it much.\" Gameplay Final Fantasy X-2 is divided up in 5 chapters, and is largely mission based as opposed to the linear structure of  Final Fantasy X . Missions are typically accessed aboard the Celsius, the Gullwing\\'s airship, and are accompanied by a star rating to indicate their respective difficulty. Battle System Battles are somewhat changed from FFX. Battles in Final Fantasy X-2 are turn-based and commands can be issued upon a character filling her  Active Time Battle  (ATB) gauge. The speed with which the ATB gauge fills depends on a character\\'s agility and the battle speed selected by the player. The battle system also features two settings: Active and Wait modes. Active mode means the player must makes all commands in real time and enemies will attack if no command is made. Wait mode allows players more breathing space by allowing time to choose targets and select items as the battle pauses when these choices are being made. As with Final Fantasy battle systems of the past, there are various elemental attacks and status ailments to contend with. Chain attacks can also be used to multiply damage against enemies. Dresspheres Perhaps the most significant addition to Final Fantasy X-2 is the inclusion of \"Dresspheres\", which each of the main characters may equip in order to change their class. Each dressphere alters it\\'s wearer\\'s attributes and abilities and allows for a large variety of party configurations. Dresspheres can also be changed during battle as to what the situation dictates. Aside from each of the main character\\'s default dressphere, they must be acquired during the game. A Garment Grid Dresspheres must also be assigned to a Garment Grid upon acquisition in order for them to be used. Each Garment Grid has a particular shape and links the dresspheres assigned to it in a unique way. When changing dressphere, which does not stop the battle until the new sphere is chosen, the player can only change to a dressphere which is linked on the Garment Grid to that which is currently equipped. In addition to the 14 standard dresspheres, Yuna, Rikku and Paine all have their own special dressphere. These can only be activated if every dressphere on their currently equipped Garment Grid has been used in the battle. The table below shows how each dressphere breaks down in terms of it\\'s effect on the attributes of the wearer. Dressphere Hit Points Strength Defence Agility Evasion Magic Points Magic Magic Defence Accuracy Luck Warrior Average High High Average Low Lowest Lowest Lowest Low Average Thief Low Low Low Highest Highest Low Low Average Average Highest Songstress Lowest Lowest Lowest High Average Average Average Average Lowest Low Gunner Low Low Low Average Low Lowest Lowest Low Highest High Black Mage Lowest Lowest Lowest Average Low High Highest Highest Lowest Low White Mage Lowest Lowest Lowest Average Low Average High Highest Lowest Low Gun Mage Lowest Average Low High Lowest Average High High High Low Alchemist Lowest Low Low Average Lowest Lowest Lowest Lowest High Average Dark Knight High Highest Highest Lowest Lowest High Average High Low Low Berserker High Highest Lowest Highest High Lowest Lowest Lowest Low Average Lady Luck Lowest Low Lowest High Average Average Low Average Highest Highest Samurai Lowest High Average High High Low Low Average Low Average Trainer Average Average Average Average Low Low Low Low Low Low Mascot (Yuna) Highest High Highest Highest High Highest Highest Highest Highest High Mascot (Rikku) Highest Average Highest Highest High Highest Highest Highest High High Mascot (Paine) Highest High Highest High Average Highest Average Highest Highest High In addition to these attribute changes, the dresspheres have their own set of abilities and skills which can be unlocked via Ability Points (AP). Yuna\\'s special dressphere is Floral Fallal, Rikku\\'s is Machima Maw and Paine\\'s Full Throttle. Each of these special dresspheres is made up of 3 sections which each have their own unique attacks and abilities. Side Missions & Mini-Games Together with a selection of side missions, including a 101 floor dungeon with the game\\'s toughest monsters, Final Fantasy X-2 features a number of mini games to break up the main game and allow players to gain extra items. A slightly altered  Blitzball  returns from FFX, and players have the opportunity to raise  Chocobos , do some desert excavation and even give a massage to one of the game\\'s early bosses. International + Last Mission This re-release of FFX-2 in Japan with English voiceovers that contains a lot of new changes exclusive to this version. Major Changes and Additions New Last Mission campaign 3 New Dresspheres New Garment Grids A new Creature Create system Support for save data from the original Final Fantasy X-2 (including changing minor sections of the story and getting different endings if players have completed original Final Fantasy X-2 save data.) Soundtrack The soundtrack to Final Fantasy X-2 was composed by  Noriko Matsueda  and  Takahito Eguchi  and published by avex trax in Japan on March 23rd, 2003. Two  J-Pop  songs were written for the game \"1000 no Kotaba\" and \"Real Emotion\", both composed by Kazuhiro Hara and performed by famous J-Pop singer  Koda Kumi . The English versions of these tracks were performed by Jade Villalon.

       "  'wikipedia-summary': \"Final Fantasy X-2 is a 2003 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation 2. Unlike most Final Fantasy games, which use self-contained stories and characters, X-2 continues the story of Final Fantasy X (2001). The story follows Yuna as she searches for Tidus, the main character of the previous game, while trying to prevent political conflicts in Spira from escalating to war.\\nFinal Fantasy X-2 was the first game in the series to feature just three player characters and an all-female main cast. The battle system incorporates Final Fantasy character classes—one of the series' signature gameplay concepts—and is one of the few entries to have multiple possible endings. The soundtrack was created by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi in lieu of long-time Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu.\\nThe game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful, selling over 5.4 million copies on PlayStation 2 and winning a number of awards. It was the last Final Fantasy game to be released by Square before it merged with Enix in April 2003. The game was re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, alongside Final Fantasy X, as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster; this version was later released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, Windows in 2016, and the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019. As of September 2021, the Final Fantasy X series had sold over 20.8 million units worldwide, and at the end of March 2022 had surpassed 21.1 million units sold around the world.\",\n",
       "  'wikipedia-gameplay': 'Final Fantasy X-2 is a role-playing video game in which players take on the role of Yuna as she explores the fictional world of Spira. In contrast to its predecessor, Final Fantasy X, players may visit almost every location in Spira from an early point in the game via airship. The field-map navigation system is largely unchanged from Final Fantasy X; players navigate large, continuous three dimensional areas by controlling the on-screen character. A few upgrades have been implemented, providing the player with extended interaction with the environment through jumping, climbing, and rotating camera angles. The game\\'s sidequests include minor tasks and quests, optional bosses and dungeons, and the most minigames of any Final Fantasy at the time of its release. These minigames include Gunner\\'s Gauntlet (a shooter game) and Sphere Break (a math-based coin game), and a management sim based on blitzball, the fictional underwater sport from Final Fantasy X.\\nUnlike its predecessor, in which the player\\'s course through the world was largely linear, Final Fantasy X-2 allows players to visit almost any location at any time. The game consists of five chapters, with each location featuring one scenario per chapter. Together, the five scenarios in one locale form a subplot of the game called an \"Episode\". Players are free to engage with as many or as few optional scenarios as they choose; only a few scenarios per chapter are required to advance the game\\'s central plot and are marked on the world navigation system as \"Hotspots\". Both Hotspots and optional scenarios contribute to a story completion tracker and the latter may indirectly influence the main narrative. Achieving 100% completion unlocks a secret ending. When the game is finished, a New Game Plus option gives players the opportunity to replay the game with different choices, with all of the items and storyline completion percentage previously achieved intact, but all character levels are reset.\\n\\nThe combat in Final Fantasy X-2 uses an enhanced version of the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which characters and enemies take actions according to their speed. This implementation of ATB allows characters to interrupt enemies while they are preparing to take an action. With precise timing, it is possible to chain attacks together for greater damage. Characters may change their character class mid-battle using dresspheres and the Garment Grid. These dresspheres, based on Final Fantasy character classes, allow access to different abilities to alter the course of battle. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. Characters have access to dresspheres placed in the nodes. Depending on the properties of the Garment Grid, changing dresspheres in battle will grant bonuses such as increased strength or added elemental effects. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere with the use of Ability Points (AP). AP is earned by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere.',\n",
       "  'wikipedia-success': True,\n",
       "  'wikipedia-plot': 'Setting and characters: Final Fantasy X-2 takes place two years after Final Fantasy X and is set in the fictional world of Spira, which consists of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi\\'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Spira is distinct from the mainly European-influenced worlds found in previous Final Fantasy games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but previously disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. The lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello comprise the remaining sentient races. The \"unsent\" are the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"fiends\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game. Unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form.\\nAesthetically, the world of Spira is largely unchanged in the two years since Final Fantasy X and many locations return. There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira\\'s people. Spira had been terrorized by a gargantuan monster called Sin for 1000 years, inhibiting technological advancement and trapping its people in a cycle of religious asceticism in hopes of praying Sin away. After Sin\\'s destruction during the events of Final Fantasy X, an era of enlightenment known as \"the Eternal Calm\" began. Yuna, a main character of the previous game, is heralded as High Summoner for her pivotal role in this battle. The priests of the Yevon religion chose to expose the truth about the order\\'s role in perpetuating the cycle, leaving the populace to decide for themselves how to live in a world without Sin. Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are embraced by the people, who have begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of blitzball. Others have become hunters of ancient treasures, ranging from coins and machinery to arcane spheres in forgotten caves and ruins. These \"sphere hunters\" pursue the knowledge of ancient civilizations contained within.\\nIn the absence of Yevon, various factions have formed. Young people were especially quick to abandon Yevon and embrace technology, while many of the older generation felt that cultural changes were happening too quickly. The most influential of the groups are the progressive Youth League led by Mevyn Nooj, the reformist New Yevon Party led by Praetor Baralai, and the Machine Faction led by Gippal which supplies weapons to both sides. By the start of the game, there are rising tensions between the Youth League and the New Yevon Party. Both groups have sought High Summoner Yuna\\'s endorsement.\\nThe three main playable characters of Final Fantasy X-2 are Yuna, Rikku, and Paine, members of the sphere hunter group called the Gullwings. Yuna was inspired to join after viewing a sphere recording that appeared to depict Tidus, her lost love who vanished during the ending of Final Fantasy X. Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles and, though their personalities are much the same as before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Spira as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. Paine is a new character designed for Final Fantasy X-2, to accommodate the game\\'s intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Several characters from Final Fantasy X appear in the game in supporting roles, including Brother, Wakka, and Lulu. Additionally, other characters are introduced in Final Fantasy X-2, such as the faction leaders and the Leblanc Syndicate, a group of sphere hunters who serve as the Gullwings\\' rivals for much of the game. The game\\'s main antagonist is Shuyin, the unsent spirit of a fallen soldier during the Machina War 1000 years ago.\\nStory: Two years after Sin\\'s defeat, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine recover Yuna\\'s stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur. Meanwhile, the Gullwings discover a sphere containing images of an ancient machina weapon called \"Vegnagun\" that was secretly buried beneath Bevelle. The weapon has enough power to threaten all of Spira. The Gullwings join forces with the Leblanc Syndicate to investigate the underground areas of the city in an attempt to destroy the machine before it can be used by either side in the upcoming conflict. Discovering a large tunnel recently dug into the floor of the weapon\\'s chamber, they realize that Vegnagun has apparently moved to the Farplane, located deep below ground.\\nDisagreements between Spira\\'s factions are exacerbated by the disappearance of their leaders, Baralai, Nooj, and Gippal. In the underground areas of Bevelle, the Gullwings discover the missing faction leaders discussing Vegnagun and learn that the machine\\'s artificial intelligence allows it to detect hostility and respond by fleeing. Paine had once been comrades with all three men during an operation in the \"Den of Woe\". Two years earlier, their squad explored the cave but a vengeful spirit drove them to kill one another. The four were the only survivors. The spirit—Shuyin, a soldier from the Machina War that led to the creation of Vegnagun—possessed Nooj and later forced him to shoot his comrades. Under Bevelle, Shuyin possesses Baralai and follows Vegnagun to the Farplane. Nooj and Gippal pursue, asking Yuna to keep things under control on the surface.\\nYuna falls into the Farplane and meets Shuyin, who mistakes her for a woman named Lenne, whose memories are recorded in the Songstress dressphere. One thousand years ago, Shuyin was a famous blitzball player in the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand and Lenne\\'s lover. Desiring to save Lenne who had been conscripted into the Machina War between Zanarkand and Bevelle, he infiltrated Bevelle to hijack their secret weapon, Vegnagun. Lenne begged him to stop and Shuyin yielded, but a group of Bevelle soldiers arrived a moment later and executed the couple. In the present, Shuyin\\'s spirit expresses anger that the people have still not understood the pain of war and plans to use Vegnagun to destroy all of Spira in retribution. The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. The Songstress dressphere displays the scene of Shuyin and Lenne\\'s last moments to all the concertgoers, opening their eyes to the unproductive nature of their disagreements.\\nAlthough the factional fighting had ceased, Shuyin\\'s plan proceeds. Joining forces with the Leblanc Syndicate again, the Gullwings make their way to the Farplane and find Gippal and Nooj already battling Vegnagun. Once the group destroys Vegnagun, Yuna masquerades as Lenne to convince Shuyin to let go, but Shuyin eventually sees through her and attacks. The Gullwings defeat him and Lenne\\'s spirit appears to soothe him as they depart together. By fulfilling certain conditions, the ancient spirits known as fayth agree to restore Tidus to life and reunite him with Yuna. Players who achieve 100% completion see an additional reunion scene in Zanarkand where the pair discuss whether he is truly real or still a dream.\\n',\n",

However, even with the peaceful life they now lived, there is emptiness in Yunaís heart that is keeping her from moving on as the others have. One day, Yuna obtains a mystical sphere that contains imagery of what might be the Blitzball player she thought was gone forever.
