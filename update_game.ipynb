       " 'wikipedia-summary': \"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin's Creed III (2012), but its modern-day sequences succeed III's own. Black Flag was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in October 2013 and a month later for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was later ported to the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Assassin's Creed Rogue in December 2019. The game was released for Google Stadia in September 2021.\\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who is manipulated into uncovering secrets related to the Assassin-Templar conflict and the precursor race known as the First Civilization. The main story is set in the West Indies during the Golden Age of Piracy from 1715 to 1722, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor and father of antagonist Haytham Kenway, as he searches for fortune and a mythical location called the Observatory, which is sought by both the Assassins and the Templars. A major plot element concerns the attempted establishment of an independent Pirate republic in the Caribbean.\\nUnlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game's setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet in an early game mission. A number of downloadable content (DLC) packs were released to support Black Flag, including Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry, a story expansion that was later made available as a standalone game in 2014. Set over a decade after Black Flag's main campaign, Freedom Cry follows Adéwalé, Edward's former quartermaster who became an Assassin.\\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag received critical acclaim and became one of the best-selling games of 2013, with over 11 million copies sold as of 2014. Critics praised the open world gameplay, improved naval combat, side-quests, graphics, narrative, characters, and pirate theme. However, the modern-day story and combat received a slightly more mixed response, while criticism fell on aspects of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. The game received several awards and nominations, including winning the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best Action Adventure Game. It was followed by Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed Unity in November 2014.\",\n",
       " 'wikipedia-gameplay': 'Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure, stealth game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The game features three main cities: Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which reside under Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. In addition, locations like Port-au-Prince and Greater Inagua are used as main story points. It also features 50 other individual locations to explore, including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations, and underwater shipwrecks, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. The game was designed to be more open than previous Assassin\\'s Creed titles, with a map of a large section of the Caribbean from where the smaller, individual locations may be accessed. It also features fewer restrictions for the player compared to Assassin\\'s Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give players the freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. The player will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages, and can engage, board, and capture passing ships or swim to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion. In addition, the hunting system has been retained from Assassin\\'s Creed III, allowing the player to hunt on land, and fish in the water, with resources gathered used to upgrade equipment via a crafting system.\\nA new aspect in the game is the Jackdaw, the ship that protagonist Edward Kenway captains. The Jackdaw is upgradeable throughout the game, and is easily accessible to the player when needed. In addition, a new underwater component has been added, allowing players to explore shipwrecks at several marked locations. The player has access to a spyglass, allowing the examination of distant ships, along with their cargo and strength. It can also help determine if an island still has animals to hunt, treasures to find, high points to reach for synchronization or additional side-quests to complete, such as assassinations and naval contracts. An updated form of the recruit system introduced in Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood is present in the game, allowing Edward to recruit crew members. While Kenway\\'s crew will remain loyal to him, they can be promoted to captain acquired ships, and are needed to assist in boarding enemy vessels. They cannot assist in combat or perform long-range assassinations, as in previous games; Ubisoft removed this aspect of the Brotherhood system, believing it allowed players to bypass tense and challenging scenarios too easily.\\nIn the present, at the offices of Abstergo Entertainment—a subsidiary of Abstergo Industries—in Montreal, Quebec, players control an unnamed protagonist from a first-person perspective and engage in modern-day pirating through the exploration of Abstergo\\'s offices, eavesdropping, and hacking, all without combat. \"Hacking\" minigames, similar to the cluster and glyph puzzles from the previous games, are also present, and completing them uncovers various secrets about Abstergo.\\nMultiplayer also returns, with new settings and game modes, though it is entirely land-based.',\n",

The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of Abstergo, to examine the memories of Desmond\\'s ancestor Edward Kenway, a famous eighteenth-century pirate. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive feature film. In reality, Abstergo—the Templars of the present time—are searching for a First Civilization structure known as the Observatory in Edward\\'s memories.\\nAs Edward, the player unravels a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars within the British and Spanish Empires. Under the guise of cleaning up piracy in the Caribbean, they have used their positions to locate the Sage—later identified as Bartholomew Roberts (Oliver Milburn)—the only man who can lead them to the Observatory. It can monitor anyone anywhere in the world when provided a blood sample, which they intend to use to spy on and blackmail world leaders. Edward inadvertently becomes involved when he kills a rogue Assassin, Duncan Walpole. Seeing an opportunity for profit, Edward takes Walpole\\'s place at a meeting of Templars in Havana, and meets Woodes Rogers (Shaun Dingwall) and Cuban Governor and Templar Grand Master Laureano Torres (Conrad Pla). His recklessness endangers the Assassin Brotherhood, prompting him to pursue the Sage and the conspirators from the Yucatán Peninsula to Jamaica, eventually catching Roberts on the island of Príncipe off of the West African coast.\\nMeanwhile, a band of notorious pirates—including Blackbeard, Benjamin Hornigold, Mary Read (under the alias \"James Kidd\"), and Charles Vane—dream of a pirate utopia where man is free to live beyond the reach of rulers. With Edward\\'s help, they seize control of Nassau and establish a pirate republic. However, poor governance, the lack of an economy, and an outbreak of disease bring the republic close to collapse, with the founders divided. Edward attempts to resolve the dispute but is too late to stop the Templars from exploiting the situation, resulting in Blackbeard being killed by the British following his retirement, Hornigold joining the Templars, and Vane going insane after Jack Rackham\\'s mutiny.\\nEventually, Edward and Roberts uncover the location of the Observatory and retrieve the artifact powering it. Roberts betrays Edward, and the British arrest him. He is imprisoned, but escapes when Ah Tabai (Octavio Solorio), the Assassin Mentor, infiltrates the prison to rescue Mary Read and Anne Bonny. Mary soon dies in the aftermath of childbirth, and a disheartened Edward decides to join the Brotherhood. Chasing down and eliminating Roberts and the Templar conspirators, Edward retrieves the artifact and returns it to the Observatory, sealing it away. He receives a letter informing him of the passing of his wife and the imminent arrival of his hitherto unknown daughter, Jennifer Scott. Edward returns to England, promising Ah Tabai that he will continue fighting the Templars. Years later, Edward attends The Beggar\\'s Opera at the Royal Opera House with Jennifer and his son Haytham.\\nIn the present, John Standish, Abstergo Entertainment\\'s information technology manager, persuades the player to investigate what their employers are trying to hide from them. Under John\\'s guidance, they hack several Animus terminals and deliver the information to Shaun Hastings (Danny Wallace) and Rebecca Crane (Eliza Schneider), undercover Assassins who have infiltrated Abstergo. When the facility is locked down after the hacks are discovered, John instructs the player to access the Animus\\'s core, at which point Juno (Nadia Verrucci) materializes into an incorporeal form. She reveals that the world is not ready for her yet, and that she is unable to possess the player as her agents intended.\\nJohn is revealed as the reincarnated Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up Juno\\'s failed resurrection, but is killed by Abstergo\\'s security, implicating him as responsible for the hacks. During his time as Roberts, the Sage admits to Edward that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever represents his best chance of achieving his ends.

       " 'wikipedia-synopsis': 'Characters: The main character of the game is Edward Kenway (voiced by Matt Ryan), a Welsh privateer-turned-pirate and eventual member of the Brotherhood of Assassins. Edward is the father of the future Colonial Templars Grand Master Haytham Kenway, and grandfather of the Assassin Ratonhnhaké:ton, the two playable characters of Assassin\\'s Creed III. During the game, Edward meets and interacts with several real-life historical figures, including notorious pirates Edward \"Blackbeard\" Thatch (Mark Bonnar), Benjamin Hornigold (Ed Stoppard), Mary Read (Olivia Morgan), Stede Bonnet (James Bachman), Anne Bonny (Sarah Greene), Calico Jack (O-T Fagbenle), and Charles Vane (Ralph Ineson).\\nSetting: As is the case in previous Assassin\\'s Creed games, the story is divided into two intertwined halves, with one set in the present day and the other in a historical setting. Although the present-day story had previously established that an Animus was required to view one\\'s ancestors memories, the ending of Assassin\\'s Creed III reveals that Abstergo can now view a host\\'s genetic memories simply by sequencing the host\\'s DNA. As such, the unseen player character is hired by Abstergo Entertainment to investigate a pivotal character in Desmond Miles\\'s ancestry, Edward Kenway. A notorious pirate and privateer operating during the Golden Age of Piracy, Kenway\\'s story is set in the Caribbean, and mixes open-ended ship-based exploration with combat and land-based adventures in Cuba and Jamaica, and on a number of Caribbean islands, parts of southern Florida and eastern Mexico.\\nPlot: In 2013, months after Desmond Miles\\'s sacrifice in Assassin\\'s Creed III, samples taken from Desmond\\'s body allow Abstergo Industries to continue exploring his genetic memories with the Animus\\'s newfound cloud computing abilities.

Players explore the memories of Edward Kenway, a charismatic pirate (turned reckless Assassin) and the grandfather of Connor Kenway, the protagonist of Assassin's Creed III.\",\n",
       " 'giantbomb-description': 'Overview Assassins in the age of piracy! Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag is an open-world action-adventure game developed by  Ubisoft Montreal  and published by  Ubisoft  for the  Xbox 360 ,  PlayStation 3 , and  Wii U  on October 29, 2013, for the  PlayStation 4  (as a  launch title ) on November 15, 2013, for the  PC  on November 19, 2013, and for the  Xbox One  (also as a launch title) on November 22, 2013. The sixth main installment of the  Assassin\\'s Creed  series (and the sequel to  Assassin\\'s Creed III ), players control an unknown  Abstergo  employee (in the year 2013, one year after the events of the previous game) who must sift through the memories of  Edward Kenway  (a notorious and reckless early-18th century  privateer -turned- Assassin  and the grandfather of  Connor Kenway ) after the genetic memory of Assassin  Desmond Miles  was uploaded into the Abstergo servers. These memories (inside the  Animus ) take place in the year 1715 throughout the  Caribbean  and the southern coast of  Florida . Edward, as an experienced pirate, travels through the dangerous Caribbean Sea in a major open-world naval experience (including  engaging passing ships , surviving tropical storms,  fishing /whaling, and exploring distant islands). Other pirates in the game are based on real, realistic pirates (rather than the comedic tropes associated with the era), featuring the famous  Blackbeard . Other pirates named include Charles Vane, Calico Jack, Anne Bonny, Ben Hornigold, and a different take on the now-famous  Jack Sparrow . A focus upon real-world occurrences, just as in previous games, will be a primary motivation for the narrative - including Bartholomew Roberts\\' assault on 42 Portuguese ships, the marooning of Charles Vane, and the Spanish Armada shipwreck. Development began in the summer of 2011 by an entirely new team, as the game was being penned by the scriptwriter of  Assassin\\'s Creed: Revelations . The game shipped on both current and next gen consoles, with PS3 and PS4 versions including \"60 minutes of exclusive gameplay\" featuring  Aveline de Grandpre  from  Assassin\\'s Creed III: Liberation . Despite these claims of exclusivity, this content is also available on PC. Gameplay Ship-boarding gameplay The World The game is an open-world naval experience with seamless boarding, tropical storms, harpooning (for whales), and underwater gameplay (exploring shipwrecks - with enemies including sharks). Approximately 40% of the game occurs across the sea, as the other 60% remains on land - with \"50 unique locations\" including fisherman villages, jungles, temples, plantations, forts, complete islands, and Mayan ruins. Each of the areas have different gameplay focuses. For example, the Mayan ruins are based around puzzle solving and platforming, while the Coconut Islands are inhabited by enemies to fight. The three largest cities, however, are Naussau (the pirate haven), Kingston (a lively, dangerous town), and Havana (the capital of Cuba). The team that worked on  Far Cry 3 \\'s open world design pitched in to add to the random elements and overall design of the Caribbean world. Added randomness includes storms and rain, which simple make things wet on land but add dangerous rogue waves and lack of visibility on sea. In major ports and on minor islands, Kenway can collect treasure chests (some of which include plans for upgrades for his ship), animus fragments ( 200 glowing Macguffins of the past), sea chanties (songs for his crew to sing aboard the  Jackdaw),  and secret letters revealing the backstory of a mysterious character. While sailing, randomly generated supplies and shipwrecked crewmen can be collected. Fighting on land With the addition of free aiming, Kenway can carry up to four guns and use them in one go. Cutlasses, swords, axes, rifles, and pistols are available. Using the d-pad, players select Kenway\\'s primary weapons (swords, hands, or hidden blades) and his secondary weapons (pistols, smoke bombs, rope darts, sleeping darts, or berzerk darts) for use in battle. The same parry-into-combo system from previous games returns, with a successful parry and kill leading into the ability to chain kills quickly. In addition, quickly hitting the secondary button with pistols equipped will fire off a volley of up to four chained shots, potentially killing four enemies in a few seconds. Kenway executes an island guard Kenway now regains health only over time when out of battle, leaving behind the health regenerating potions of previous games. This means that the player must decide whether to run or fight it out when low on health. Assassination techniques of air, ground, double, and running assassinations make their return. Added here is the ability to tag enemies using Eagle Vision. If the player looks at enemies for a few seconds in this vision mode, a dot will appear over their heads and, upon returning to regular vision, that enemy will be highlighted. Highlighted enemies appear through walls, making awareness of their status and tracking them (especially during eavesdropping missions) far easier. Fighting on sea Kenway\\'s greatest ally is his ship, The  Jackdaw.  Acquired during the story, the ship grows with the player\\'s input. Salvaging supplies from warehouses or the open sea can give the player materials to upgrade the ship, but in order to truly improve her, the player must fight, incapacitate, and board other ships. Doing so will net the greatest amount of money, crew, ammunition, and upgrade materials in the form of cloth, wood, or metal. Using a spyglass reveals what each ship is carrying, its level (strength vs. the player\\'s strength), and its type (gunboat, schooner, brig, frigate, or man o\\' war). During a fort battle, smaller ships often attack as well Revising the system from Assassin\\'s Creed III, AC IV places each type of ship-board weapon at a different location on the ship. When the player looks forward, they can fire the chain shot, which takes down enemy sails and makes them less maneuverable. Looking to either side brings up the aiming arc of the broadside cannons, the general damage weapon. Simply hitting the fire button from the side view will fire heavy shot, a flaming, short range attack that does massive damage. The back view will fire exploding barrels behind the player. Additionally, when acquired mortars can be fired at any time, with their button generating an aiming circle that can be moved side to side and forward and backward. Successful destruction of an enemy ship results in explosions and burning sails, but it also gives the player the ability to board the ship. Choosing to board puts the player in control of Kenway with escalating requirements for success based on the power of the ship. While schooners simple require five dead crewmen, man o\\' wars require 20 dead, a destroyed flag, or killed officers or gunmen, or destroyed powder stores. Upon successful boarding, the player can choose to repair their own ship by destroying this one, lower their sea-based wanted level by converting the ship, or send the ship to the second-screen and general mini-game Kenway\\'s Fleet. To take down forts that reveal sections of islands on the map and make areas less dangerous, the player must attack the stationary target while it fires cannon, heavy shot, and mortars at the  Jackdaw.  Present Day Abstergo Entertainment The player takes on the role of an  Abstergo Industries  employee in October 2013, rather than that of  Desmond Miles , who is dead. These sections play out in first-person, with a tablet acting as a map and database access. Later, the player is giving the ability to hack into employee a security computers. The banality of evil is so meta Hacking consists of three variants. One is a spherical puzzle where the player needs to direct the cursor onto a green line. The second is a frogger-like grid where the player\\'s cursor must cross multiple moving lines, some of them red and deadly, to get to the other side. The final is a mathematical graph where the player is given a final number to reach and multiple single numbers to multiply together. Some later terminals require multiple mini-games to break into. Successful hacking reveals recordings of Desmond, subject zero, and emails, books, and movies from Abstergo marketing and development. Players can also explore the offices, finding collectible sticky notes from a deranged person, listening to employee banter, and accessing secure areas. Multiplayer As in previous games, multiplayer centers around templar avatars, some of whom Kenway kills in the single player. The multiplayer side of Assassin\\'s Creed 4 features six different competitive game modes, a 4 player co-op mode, and introduces Gamelab, a way to create custom matches: Free-For-All modes Deathmatch  - The player is given an assassination contract of another player. This mode is played on smaller maps, where the compass and lookalikes are both turned off. Wanted  - Much like Deathmatch except you are working within a full map, lookalikes are turned on and you have a compass to help you find your mark. Assassinate  - In this mode, no contracts are given, instead players have to discern who other real players are based on their behavior, and assassinate them. Team Modes Manhunt  - This mode is split into two rounds. In one round one team are the hunters and the other team is the prey. In the second round, the roles are reversed. Artifact Assault  - This mode is essentially Capture The Flag. Players are not allowed to assassinate while in enemy territory. Domination  - This mode is a version of Conquest, where teams must capture and hold specific points on the map. Wolfpack  - This co-op mode tasks players to work together to take down NPCs within a time limit. Synchronized assassinations aren’t necessary, but if players don’t time kills properly, other targets will flee, wasting precious time as you hunt them down to finish the job. Gamelab Gamelab gives the player the opportunity to build their own custom multiplayer modes by tweaking over 200 different parameters, such as scoring, ability sets, time limits, weapons, etc. The best community-made modes will grow as they gain followers, and Ubisoft will promote the most popular ones into the public playlist.

       " 'text-wikipedia': 'Wikipedia: \\nSummary: Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin\\'s Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin\\'s Creed III (2012), but its modern-day sequences succeed III\\'s own. Black Flag was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in October 2013 and a month later for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was later ported to the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Assassin\\'s Creed Rogue in December 2019. The game was released for Google Stadia in September 2021.\\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who is manipulated into uncovering secrets related to the Assassin-Templar conflict and the precursor race known as the First Civilization. The main story is set in the West Indies during the Golden Age of Piracy from 1715 to 1722, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather of Assassin\\'s Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor and father of antagonist Haytham Kenway, as he searches for fortune and a mythical location called the Observatory, which is sought by both the Assassins and the Templars. A major plot element concerns the attempted establishment of an independent Pirate republic in the Caribbean.\\nUnlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series\\' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game\\'s setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin\\'s Creed game, where Edward captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet in an early game mission. A number of downloadable content (DLC) packs were released to support Black Flag, including Assassin\\'s Creed Freedom Cry, a story expansion that was later made available as a standalone game in 2014. Set over a decade after Black Flag\\'s main campaign, Freedom Cry follows Adéwalé, Edward\\'s former quartermaster who became an Assassin.\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag received critical acclaim and became one of the best-selling games of 2013, with over 11 million copies sold as of 2014. Critics praised the open world gameplay, improved naval combat, side-quests, graphics, narrative, characters, and pirate theme. However, the modern-day story and combat received a slightly more mixed response, while criticism fell on aspects of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. The game received several awards and nominations, including winning the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best Action Adventure Game. It was followed by Assassin\\'s Creed Rogue and Assassin\\'s Creed Unity in November 2014.\\nGameplay: Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure, stealth game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The game features three main cities: Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which reside under Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. In addition, locations like Port-au-Prince and Greater Inagua are used as main story points. It also features 50 other individual locations to explore, including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations, and underwater shipwrecks, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. The game was designed to be more open than previous Assassin\\'s Creed titles, with a map of a large section of the Caribbean from where the smaller, individual locations may be accessed. It also features fewer restrictions for the player compared to Assassin\\'s Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give players the freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. The player will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages, and can engage, board, and capture passing ships or swim to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion. In addition, the hunting system has been retained from Assassin\\'s Creed III, allowing the player to hunt on land, and fish in the water, with resources gathered used to upgrade equipment via a crafting system.\\nA new aspect in the game is the Jackdaw, the ship that protagonist Edward Kenway captains. The Jackdaw is upgradeable throughout the game, and is easily accessible to the player when needed. In addition, a new underwater component has been added, allowing players to explore shipwrecks at several marked locations. The player has access to a spyglass, allowing the examination of distant ships, along with their cargo and strength. It can also help determine if an island still has animals to hunt, treasures to find, high points to reach for synchronization or additional side-quests to complete, such as assassinations and naval contracts. An updated form of the recruit system introduced in Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood is present in the game, allowing Edward to recruit crew members. While Kenway\\'s crew will remain loyal to him, they can be promoted to captain acquired ships, and are needed to assist in boarding enemy vessels. They cannot assist in combat or perform long-range assassinations, as in previous games; Ubisoft removed this aspect of the Brotherhood system, believing it allowed players to bypass tense and challenging scenarios too easily.\\nIn the present, at the offices of Abstergo Entertainment—a subsidiary of Abstergo Industries—in Montreal, Quebec, players control an unnamed protagonist from a first-person perspective and engage in modern-day pirating through the exploration of Abstergo\\'s offices, eavesdropping, and hacking, all without combat. \"Hacking\" minigames, similar to the cluster and glyph puzzles from the previous games, are also present, and completing them uncovers various secrets about Abstergo.\\nMultiplayer also returns, with new settings and game modes, though it is entirely land-based.\\nPlot: In 2013, months after Desmond Miles\\'s sacrifice in Assassin\\'s Creed III, samples taken from Desmond\\'s body allow Abstergo Industries to continue exploring his genetic memories with the Animus\\'s newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of Abstergo, to examine the memories of Desmond\\'s ancestor Edward Kenway, a famous eighteenth-century pirate. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive feature film. In reality, Abstergo—the Templars of the present time—are searching for a First Civilization structure known as the Observatory in Edward\\'s memories.\\nAs Edward, the player unravels a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars within the British and Spanish Empires. Under the guise of cleaning up piracy in the Caribbean, they have used their positions to locate the Sage—later identified as Bartholomew Roberts (Oliver Milburn)—the only man who can lead them to the Observatory. It can monitor anyone anywhere in the world when provided a blood sample, which they intend to use to spy on and blackmail world leaders. Edward inadvertently becomes involved when he kills a rogue Assassin, Duncan Walpole. Seeing an opportunity for profit, Edward takes Walpole\\'s place at a meeting of Templars in Havana, and meets Woodes Rogers (Shaun Dingwall) and Cuban Governor and Templar Grand Master Laureano Torres (Conrad Pla). His recklessness endangers the Assassin Brotherhood, prompting him to pursue the Sage and the conspirators from the Yucatán Peninsula to Jamaica, eventually catching Roberts on the island of Príncipe off of the West African coast.\\nMeanwhile, a band of notorious pirates—including Blackbeard, Benjamin Hornigold, Mary Read (under the alias \"James Kidd\"), and Charles Vane—dream of a pirate utopia where man is free to live beyond the reach of rulers. With Edward\\'s help, they seize control of Nassau and establish a pirate republic. However, poor governance, the lack of an economy, and an outbreak of disease bring the republic close to collapse, with the founders divided. Edward attempts to resolve the dispute but is too late to stop the Templars from exploiting the situation, resulting in Blackbeard being killed by the British following his retirement, Hornigold joining the Templars, and Vane going insane after Jack Rackham\\'s mutiny.\\nEventually, Edward and Roberts uncover the location of the Observatory and retrieve the artifact powering it.

Mary soon dies in the aftermath of childbirth, and a disheartened Edward decides to join the Brotherhood. Chasing down and eliminating Roberts and the Templar conspirators, Edward retrieves the artifact and returns it to the Observatory, sealing it away. He receives a letter informing him of the passing of his wife and the imminent arrival of his hitherto unknown daughter, Jennifer Scott.

When the facility is locked down after the hacks are discovered, John instructs the player to access the Animus\\'s core, at which point Juno (Nadia Verrucci) materializes into an incorporeal form. She reveals that the world is not ready for her yet, and that she is unable to possess the player as her agents intended.\\nJohn is revealed as the reincarnated Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up Juno\\'s failed resurrection, but is killed by Abstergo\\'s security, implicating him as responsible for the hacks. During his time as Roberts, the Sage admits to Edward that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever represents his best chance of achieving his ends. With the Sage dead, the player is contacted by the Assassins, but neither side is able to explain the Sage\\'s presence or identify his followers, the Instruments of the First Will.\\nSynopsis: Characters: The main character of the game is Edward Kenway (voiced by Matt Ryan), a Welsh privateer-turned-pirate and eventual member of the Brotherhood of Assassins. Edward is the father of the future Colonial Templars Grand Master Haytham Kenway, and grandfather of the Assassin Ratonhnhaké:ton, the two playable characters of Assassin\\'s Creed III. During the game, Edward meets and interacts with several real-life historical figures, including notorious pirates Edward \"Blackbeard\" Thatch (Mark Bonnar), Benjamin Hornigold (Ed Stoppard), Mary Read (Olivia Morgan), Stede Bonnet (James Bachman), Anne Bonny (Sarah Greene), Calico Jack (O-T Fagbenle), and Charles Vane (Ralph Ineson).\\nSetting: As is the case in previous Assassin\\'s Creed games, the story is divided into two intertwined halves, with one set in the present day and the other in a historical setting. Although the present-day story had previously established that an Animus was required to view one\\'s ancestors memories, the ending of Assassin\\'s Creed III reveals that Abstergo can now view a host\\'s genetic memories simply by sequencing the host\\'s DNA. As such, the unseen player character is hired by Abstergo Entertainment to investigate a pivotal character in Desmond Miles\\'s ancestry, Edward Kenway. A notorious pirate and privateer operating during the Golden Age of Piracy, Kenway\\'s story is set in the Caribbean, and mixes open-ended ship-based exploration with combat and land-based adventures in Cuba and Jamaica, and on a number of Caribbean islands, parts of southern Florida and eastern Mexico.\\nPlot: In 2013, months after Desmond Miles\\'s sacrifice in Assassin\\'s Creed III, samples taken from Desmond\\'s body allow Abstergo Industries to continue exploring his genetic memories with the Animus\\'s newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of Abstergo, to examine the memories of Desmond\\'s ancestor Edward Kenway, a famous eighteenth-century pirate. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive feature film. In reality, Abstergo—the Templars of the present time—are searching for a First Civilization structure known as the Observatory in Edward\\'s memories.\\nAs Edward, the player unravels a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars within the British and Spanish Empires. Under the guise of cleaning up piracy in the Caribbean, they have used their positions to locate the Sage—later identified as Bartholomew Roberts (Oliver Milburn)—the only man who can lead them to the Observatory. It can monitor anyone anywhere in the world when provided a blood sample, which they intend to use to spy on and blackmail world leaders. Edward inadvertently becomes involved when he kills a rogue Assassin, Duncan Walpole. Seeing an opportunity for profit, Edward takes Walpole\\'s place at a meeting of Templars in Havana, and meets Woodes Rogers (Shaun Dingwall) and Cuban Governor and Templar Grand Master Laureano Torres (Conrad Pla). His recklessness endangers the Assassin Brotherhood, prompting him to pursue the Sage and the conspirators from the Yucatán Peninsula to Jamaica, eventually catching Roberts on the island of Príncipe off of the West African coast.\\nMeanwhile, a band of notorious pirates—including Blackbeard, Benjamin Hornigold, Mary Read (under the alias \"James Kidd\"), and Charles Vane—dream of a pirate utopia where man is free to live beyond the reach of rulers. With Edward\\'s help, they seize control of Nassau and establish a pirate republic. However, poor governance, the lack of an economy, and an outbreak of disease bring the republic close to collapse, with the founders divided. Edward attempts to resolve the dispute but is too late to stop the Templars from exploiting the situation, resulting in Blackbeard being killed by the British following his retirement, Hornigold joining the Templars, and Vane going insane after Jack Rackham\\'s mutiny.\\nEventually, Edward and Roberts uncover the location of the Observatory and retrieve the artifact powering it.

       " 'text-giantbomb': 'GiantBomb: \\nIntro: The sixth main installment of the Assassin\\'s Creed franchise, set in the Caribbean during the age of piracy in the early 18th century. Players explore the memories of Edward Kenway, a charismatic pirate (turned reckless Assassin) and the grandfather of Connor Kenway, the protagonist of Assassin\\'s Creed III.\\nDescription: Overview Assassins in the age of piracy! Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag is an open-world action-adventure game developed by  Ubisoft Montreal  and published by  Ubisoft  for the  Xbox 360 ,  PlayStation 3 , and  Wii U  on October 29, 2013, for the  PlayStation 4  (as a  launch title ) on November 15, 2013, for the  PC  on November 19, 2013, and for the  Xbox One  (also as a launch title) on November 22, 2013. The sixth main installment of the  Assassin\\'s Creed  series (and the sequel to  Assassin\\'s Creed III ), players control an unknown  Abstergo  employee (in the year 2013, one year after the events of the previous game) who must sift through the memories of  Edward Kenway  (a notorious and reckless early-18th century  privateer -turned- Assassin  and the grandfather of  Connor Kenway ) after the genetic memory of Assassin  Desmond Miles  was uploaded into the Abstergo servers. These memories (inside the  Animus ) take place in the year 1715 throughout the  Caribbean  and the southern coast of  Florida . Edward, as an experienced pirate, travels through the dangerous Caribbean Sea in a major open-world naval experience (including  engaging passing ships , surviving tropical storms,  fishing /whaling, and exploring distant islands). Other pirates in the game are based on real, realistic pirates (rather than the comedic tropes associated with the era), featuring the famous  Blackbeard . Other pirates named include Charles Vane, Calico Jack, Anne Bonny, Ben Hornigold, and a different take on the now-famous  Jack Sparrow . A focus upon real-world occurrences, just as in previous games, will be a primary motivation for the narrative - including Bartholomew Roberts\\' assault on 42 Portuguese ships, the marooning of Charles Vane, and the Spanish Armada shipwreck. Development began in the summer of 2011 by an entirely new team, as the game was being penned by the scriptwriter of  Assassin\\'s Creed: Revelations . The game shipped on both current and next gen consoles, with PS3 and PS4 versions including \"60 minutes of exclusive gameplay\" featuring  Aveline de Grandpre  from  Assassin\\'s Creed III: Liberation . Despite these claims of exclusivity, this content is also available on PC. Gameplay Ship-boarding gameplay The World The game is an open-world naval experience with seamless boarding, tropical storms, harpooning (for whales), and underwater gameplay (exploring shipwrecks - with enemies including sharks). Approximately 40% of the game occurs across the sea, as the other 60% remains on land - with \"50 unique locations\" including fisherman villages, jungles, temples, plantations, forts, complete islands, and Mayan ruins. Each of the areas have different gameplay focuses. For example, the Mayan ruins are based around puzzle solving and platforming, while the Coconut Islands are inhabited by enemies to fight. The three largest cities, however, are Naussau (the pirate haven), Kingston (a lively, dangerous town), and Havana (the capital of Cuba). The team that worked on  Far Cry 3 \\'s open world design pitched in to add to the random elements and overall design of the Caribbean world. Added randomness includes storms and rain, which simple make things wet on land but add dangerous rogue waves and lack of visibility on sea. In major ports and on minor islands, Kenway can collect treasure chests (some of which include plans for upgrades for his ship), animus fragments ( 200 glowing Macguffins of the past), sea chanties (songs for his crew to sing aboard the  Jackdaw),  and secret letters revealing the backstory of a mysterious character. While sailing, randomly generated supplies and shipwrecked crewmen can be collected. Fighting on land With the addition of free aiming, Kenway can carry up to four guns and use them in one go. Cutlasses, swords, axes, rifles, and pistols are available. Using the d-pad, players select Kenway\\'s primary weapons (swords, hands, or hidden blades) and his secondary weapons (pistols, smoke bombs, rope darts, sleeping darts, or berzerk darts) for use in battle. The same parry-into-combo system from previous games returns, with a successful parry and kill leading into the ability to chain kills quickly. In addition, quickly hitting the secondary button with pistols equipped will fire off a volley of up to four chained shots, potentially killing four enemies in a few seconds. Kenway executes an island guard Kenway now regains health only over time when out of battle, leaving behind the health regenerating potions of previous games. This means that the player must decide whether to run or fight it out when low on health. Assassination techniques of air, ground, double, and running assassinations make their return. Added here is the ability to tag enemies using Eagle Vision. If the player looks at enemies for a few seconds in this vision mode, a dot will appear over their heads and, upon returning to regular vision, that enemy will be highlighted. Highlighted enemies appear through walls, making awareness of their status and tracking them (especially during eavesdropping missions) far easier. Fighting on sea Kenway\\'s greatest ally is his ship, The  Jackdaw.  Acquired during the story, the ship grows with the player\\'s input. Salvaging supplies from warehouses or the open sea can give the player materials to upgrade the ship, but in order to truly improve her, the player must fight, incapacitate, and board other ships. Doing so will net the greatest amount of money, crew, ammunition, and upgrade materials in the form of cloth, wood, or metal. Using a spyglass reveals what each ship is carrying, its level (strength vs. the player\\'s strength), and its type (gunboat, schooner, brig, frigate, or man o\\' war). During a fort battle, smaller ships often attack as well Revising the system from Assassin\\'s Creed III, AC IV places each type of ship-board weapon at a different location on the ship. When the player looks forward, they can fire the chain shot, which takes down enemy sails and makes them less maneuverable. Looking to either side brings up the aiming arc of the broadside cannons, the general damage weapon. Simply hitting the fire button from the side view will fire heavy shot, a flaming, short range attack that does massive damage. The back view will fire exploding barrels behind the player. Additionally, when acquired mortars can be fired at any time, with their button generating an aiming circle that can be moved side to side and forward and backward. Successful destruction of an enemy ship results in explosions and burning sails, but it also gives the player the ability to board the ship. Choosing to board puts the player in control of Kenway with escalating requirements for success based on the power of the ship. While schooners simple require five dead crewmen, man o\\' wars require 20 dead, a destroyed flag, or killed officers or gunmen, or destroyed powder stores. Upon successful boarding, the player can choose to repair their own ship by destroying this one, lower their sea-based wanted level by converting the ship, or send the ship to the second-screen and general mini-game Kenway\\'s Fleet. To take down forts that reveal sections of islands on the map and make areas less dangerous, the player must attack the stationary target while it fires cannon, heavy shot, and mortars at the  Jackdaw.  Present Day Abstergo Entertainment The player takes on the role of an  Abstergo Industries  employee in October 2013, rather than that of  Desmond Miles , who is dead. These sections play out in first-person, with a tablet acting as a map and database access. Later, the player is giving the ability to hack into employee a security computers. The banality of evil is so meta Hacking consists of three variants. One is a spherical puzzle where the player needs to direct the cursor onto a green line. The second is a frogger-like grid where the player\\'s cursor must cross multiple moving lines, some of them red and deadly, to get to the other side. The final is a mathematical graph where the player is given a final number to reach and multiple single numbers to multiply together. Some later terminals require multiple mini-games to break into. Successful hacking reveals recordings of Desmond, subject zero, and emails, books, and movies from Abstergo marketing and development. Players can also explore the offices, finding collectible sticky notes from a deranged person, listening to employee banter, and accessing secure areas. Multiplayer As in previous games, multiplayer centers around templar avatars, some of whom Kenway kills in the single player. The multiplayer side of Assassin\\'s Creed 4 features six different competitive game modes, a 4 player co-op mode, and introduces Gamelab, a way to create custom matches: Free-For-All modes Deathmatch  - The player is given an assassination contract of another player. This mode is played on smaller maps, where the compass and lookalikes are both turned off. Wanted  - Much like Deathmatch except you are working within a full map, lookalikes are turned on and you have a compass to help you find your mark. Assassinate  - In this mode, no contracts are given, instead players have to discern who other real players are based on their behavior, and assassinate them. Team Modes Manhunt  - This mode is split into two rounds. In one round one team are the hunters and the other team is the prey. In the second round, the roles are reversed. Artifact Assault  - This mode is essentially Capture The Flag. Players are not allowed to assassinate while in enemy territory. Domination  - This mode is a version of Conquest, where teams must capture and hold specific points on the map. Wolfpack  - This co-op mode tasks players to work together to take down NPCs within a time limit. Synchronized assassinations aren’t necessary, but if players don’t time kills properly, other targets will flee, wasting precious time as you hunt them down to finish the job. Gamelab Gamelab gives the player the opportunity to build their own custom multiplayer modes by tweaking over 200 different parameters, such as scoring, ability sets, time limits, weapons, etc. The best community-made modes will grow as they gain followers, and Ubisoft will promote the most popular ones into the public playlist.
